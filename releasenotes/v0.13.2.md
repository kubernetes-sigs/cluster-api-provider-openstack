## Highlights

**NOTE:** Pervious releases of v0.13 (v0.13.0 and v0.13.1) incorrectly
advertised v1beta2 contract support in the metadata.yaml. This has been fixed in
this version. CAPO v0.13 does NOT fully implement v1beta2 and CAPI will in fact
use v1beta1 with it. We do however test CAPI's v1beta2 API and it works well
together with CAPO since there is still backwards compatibility with the v1beta1
contract.
