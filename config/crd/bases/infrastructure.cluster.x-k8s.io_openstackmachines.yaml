                            VNICType specifies the type of vNIC which this port should be
                            attached to. This is used to determine which mechanism driver(s) to
                            be used to bind the port. The valid values are normal, macvtap,
                            direct, baremetal, direct-physical, virtio-forwarder, smart-nic and
                            remote-managed, although these values will not be validated in this
                            API to ensure compatibility with future neutron changes or custom
                            implementations. What type of vNIC is actually available depends on
                            deployments. If not specified, the Neutron default value is used.
