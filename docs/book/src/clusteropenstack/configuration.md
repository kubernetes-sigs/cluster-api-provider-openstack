# Required configuration

The cluster configuration file can be generated by using [`clusterctl config cluster`](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start.html#generating-the-cluster-configuration) command.
This command actually uses [the template file](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/blob/main/templates/cluster-template.yaml) and replace the values surrounded by `${}` with environment variables. You have to set all required environment variables in advance. The following sections explain some more details about what should be configured.

Note: You can use [the template file](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/blob/main/templates/cluster-template.yaml) by manually replacing values.

**Note:** By default the command creates highly available control plane with internal OpenStack cloud provider. If you wish to create highly available control plane with external OpenStack cloud provider or single control plane without load balancer, use external-cloud-provider or without-lb [flavor](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/clusterctl/commands/config-cluster.html#flavors) respectively. For example,

```bash
# Using 'external-cloud-provider' flavor
clusterctl config cluster capi-quickstart \
  --flavor external-cloud-provider \
  --kubernetes-version v1.21.3 \
  --control-plane-machine-count=3 \
  --worker-machine-count=1 \
  > capi-quickstart.yaml

# Using 'without-lb' flavor
clusterctl config cluster capi-quickstart \
  --flavor without-lb \
  --kubernetes-version v1.21.3 \
  --control-plane-machine-count=1 \
  --worker-machine-count=1 \
  > capi-quickstart.yaml
```

## OpenStack version

We currently require at least OpenStack Pike.

## Operating system image

We currently depend on an up-to-date version of cloud-init otherwise the operating system choice is yours. The kubeadm bootstrap provider we're using also depends on some pre-installed software like a container runtime, kubelet, kubeadm, etc.. . For an examples how to build such an image take a look at [image-builder (openstack)](https://image-builder.sigs.k8s.io/capi/providers/openstack.html).

The image can be referenced by exposing it as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_IMAGE_NAME`.

## SSH key pair

The SSH key pair is required. You can create one using,

```bash
openstack keypair create [--public-key <file> | --private-key <file>] <name>
```

The key pair name must be exposed as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_SSH_KEY_NAME`.

In order to access cluster nodes via SSH, you must either
[access nodes through the bastion host](#accessing-nodes-through-the-bastion-host-via-ssh)
or [configure custom security groups](#security-groups) with rules allowing ingress for port 22.

## OpenStack credential

### Generate credentials
The [env.rc](../templates/env.rc) script sets the environment variables related to credentials.

```bash
source env.rc <path/to/clouds.yaml> <cloud>
```

The following variables are set.

| Variable | Meaning |
 :----- | :-------- 
| OPENSTACK_CLOUD | The cloud name which is used as second argument |
| OPENSTACK_CLOUD_YAML_B64 | The secret used by Cluster API Provider OpenStack accessing OpenStack |
| OPENSTACK_CLOUD_PROVIDER_CONF_B64 | The content of [cloud.conf](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/#cloud-conf) which is used by OpenStack cloud provider |
| OPENSTACK_CLOUD_CACERT_B64 | (Optional) The content of your custom CA file which can be specified in your clouds.yaml by `ca-file` |

Note: Only the [external cloud provider](./external-cloud-provider.md) supports [Application Credentials](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/latest/user/application_credentials.html).

Note: you need to set `clusterctl.cluster.x-k8s.io/move` label for the secret created from `OPENSTACK_CLOUD_YAML_B64` in order to successfully move objects from bootstrap cluster to target cluster. See [bug 626](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-openstack/issues/626) for further information.

## Availability zone

The availability zone names must be exposed as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_FAILURE_DOMAIN`.

## DNS server

The DNS servers must be exposed as an environment variable `OPENSTACK_DNS_NAMESERVERS`.

## Machine flavor

The flavors for control plane and worker node machines must be exposed as environment variables `OPENSTACK_CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_FLAVOR` and `OPENSTACK_NODE_MACHINE_FLAVOR` respectively. 

# Optional Configuration

## Log level

When running CAPO with `--v=6` the gophercloud client logs its requests to the OpenStack API. This can be helpful during debugging.

## External network

If there is only a single external network it will be detected automatically. If there is more than one external network you can specify which one the cluster should use by setting the environment variable `OPENSTACK_EXTERNAL_NETWORK_ID`.

The public network id can be obtained by using command,

```bash
openstack network list --external
```

Note: If your openstack cluster does not already have a public network, you should contact your cloud service provider. We will not review how to troubleshoot this here.

## API server floating IP

Unless explicitly disabled, a floating IP is automatically created and associated with the load balancer
or controller node. If required, you can specify the floating IP explicitly by `spec.apiServerFloatingIP`
of `OpenStackCluster`.

You have to be able to create a floating IP in your OpenStack in advance. You can create one using,

```bash
openstack floating ip create <public network>
```

Note: Only user with admin role can create a floating IP with specific IP.

### Disabling the API server floating IP

It is possible to provision a cluster without a floating IP for the API server by setting
`OpenStackCluster.spec.disableAPIServerFloatingIP: true` (the default is `false`). This will
prevent a floating IP from being allocated.

> **WARNING**
>
> If the API server does not have a floating IP, workload clusters will only deploy successfully
> when the management cluster and workload cluster control plane nodes are on the same network.
> This can be a project-specific network, if the management cluster lives in the same project
> as the workload cluster, or a network that is shared across multiple projects.
>
> In particular, this means that the cluster **cannot** use `OpenStackCluster.spec.nodeCidr`
> to provision a new network for the cluster. Instead, use `OpenStackCluster.spec.network`
> to explicitly specify the same network as the management cluster is on.

When the API server floating IP is disabled, it is **not possible** to provision a cluster
without a load balancer without additional configuration (an advanced use-case that is not
documented here). This is because the API server must still have a
[virtual IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_IP_address) that is not associated with
a particular control plane node in order to allow the nodes to change underneath, e.g.
during an upgrade. When the API server has a floating IP, this role is fulfilled by the
floating IP even if there is no load balancer. When the API server does not have a floating
IP, the load balancer virtual IP on the cluster network is used.

## Network Filters

If you have a complex query that you want to use to lookup a network, then you can do this by using a network filter. More details about the filter can be found in [NetworkParam](../api/v1alpha4/types.go)

By using filters to look up a network, please note that it is possible to get multiple networks as a result. This should not be a problem, however please test your filters with `openstack network list` to be certain that it returns the networks you want. Please refer to the following usage example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filter:
      name: <network-name>
```

## Multiple Networks

You can specify multiple networks (or subnets) to connect your server to. To do this, simply add another entry in the networks array. The following example connects the server to 3 different networks:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filter:
      name: myNetwork
      tags: myTag
  - uuid: your_network_id
  - subnet_id: your_subnet_id
```

## Subnet Filters

Rather than just using a network, you have the option of specifying a specific subnet to connect your server to. The following is an example of how to specify a specific subnet of a network to use for your server.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  networks:
  - filter:
      name: <network-name>
    subnets:
    - filter:
       name: <subnet-name>
```

## Ports

A server can also be connected to networks by describing what ports to create. Describing a server's connection with `ports` allows for finer and more advanced configuration. For example, you can specify per-port security groups, fixed IPs, VNIC type or profile.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  ports:
  - networkId: <your-network-id>
    description: <your-custom-port-description>
    vnicType: normal
    fixedIPs:
    - subnetId: <your-subnet-id>
      ipAddress: <your-fixed-ip>
    securityGroups:
    - <your-security-group-id>
    profile:
      capabilities:
        - <capability>
```

Any such ports are created in addition to ports used for connections to networks or subnets.

Also, `port security` can be applied to specific port to enable/disable the `port security` on that port; When not set, it takes the value of the corresponding field at the network level.

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  ports:
  - networkId: <your-network-id>
    ...
    disablePortSecurity: true
    ...
```

## Security groups

Security groups are used to determine which ports of the cluster nodes are accessible from where.

If `spec.managedSecurityGroups` of `OpenStackCluster` is set to `true`, two security groups named
`k8s-cluster-${NAMESPACE}-${CLUSTER_NAME}-secgroup-controlplane` and
`k8s-cluster-${NAMESPACE}-${CLUSTER_NAME}-secgroup-worker` will be created and added to the control
plane and worker nodes respectively.

By default, these groups have rules that allow the following traffic:

  * Control plane nodes 
    * API server traffic from anywhere
    * Etcd traffic from other control plane nodes
    * Kubelet traffic from other cluster nodes
    * Calico CNI traffic from other cluster nodes
  * Worker nodes
    * Node port traffic from anywhere
    * Kubelet traffic from other cluster nodes
    * Calico CNI traffic from other cluster nodes

To use a CNI other than Calico, the flag `OpenStackCluster.spec.allowAllInClusterTraffic` can be
set to `true`. With this flag set, the rules for the managed security groups permit all traffic
between cluster nodes on all ports and protocols (API server and node port traffic is still
permitted from anywhere, as with the default rules).

If this is not flexible enough, pre-existing security groups can be added to the
spec of an `OpenStackMachineTemplate`, e.g.:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachineTemplate
metadata:
  name: ${CLUSTER_NAME}-control-plane
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      securityGroups:
      - name: allow-ssh
```

## Tagging

You have the ability to tag all resources created by the cluster in the `cluster.yaml` file. Here is an example how to configure tagging:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackCluster
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  tags:
  - cluster-tag
```

To tag 
resources specific to a machine, add a value to the tags field in `controlplane.yaml` and `machinedeployment.yaml` like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  tags:
  - machine-tag
```

## Metadata

You also have the option to add metadata to instances. Here is a usage example:

```yaml
apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: OpenStackMachine
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
  namespace: <cluster-name>
spec:
  serverMetadata:
    name: bob
    nickname: bobbert
```

## Boot From Volume

1. For example in `OpenStackMachineTemplate` set `spec.rootVolume.diskSize` to something greater than `0` means boot from volume.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: infrastructure.cluster.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
   kind: OpenStackMachineTemplate
   metadata:
     name: <cluster-name>-controlplane
     namespace: <cluster-name>
   spec:
   ...
     rootVolume:
       diskSize: <image size>
       sourceType: "image"
       sourceUUID: <image id>
   ...
   ```

## Timeout settings

If creating servers in your OpenStack takes a long time, you can increase the timeout, by default it's 5 minutes. You can set it via the `CLUSTER_API_OPENSTACK_INSTANCE_CREATE_TIMEOUT` in your Cluster API Provider OpenStack controller deployment.

## Custom pod network CIDR

If `192.168.0.0/16` is already in use within your network, you must select a different pod network CIDR. You have to replace the CIDR `192.168.0.0/16` with your own in the generated file.

## Accessing nodes through the bastion host via SSH

### Enabling the bastion host

To configure the Cluster API Provider for OpenStack to create a SSH bastion host, add this line to the OpenStackCluster spec after `clusterctl config cluster` was successfully executed:

```yaml
  bastion:
    enabled: true
    instance:
      flavor: <Flavor name>
      image:  <Image name>
      sshKeyName: <Key pair name>
```

A floating IP is created and associated to the bastion host automatically, but you can add the IP address explicitly:

```yaml
  bastion:
    ...
        floatingIP: <Floating IP address>
```

If `managedSecurityGroups: true`, security group rule opening 22/tcp is added to security groups for bastion, controller, and worker nodes respectively. Otherwise, you have to add `securityGroups` to the `bastion` in `OpenStackCluster` spec and `OpenStackMachineTemplate` spec template respectively.

### Obtain floating IP address of the bastion node

Once the workload cluster is up and running after being configured for an SSH bastion host, you can use the kubectl get openstackcluster command to look up the floating IP address of the bastion host (make sure the kubectl context is set to the management cluster). The output will look something like this:


```yaml
$ kubectl get openstackcluster
NAME    CLUSTER   READY   NETWORK                                SUBNET                                 BASTION
nonha   nonha     true    2e2a2fad-28c0-4159-8898-c0a2241a86a7   53cb77ab-86a6-4f2c-8d87-24f8411f15de   10.0.0.213
```
